/*  NOTE:


. const
Scope: Block-scoped (like let).
Hoisting: Variables declared with const are also hoisted but not initialized (using them before declaration throws a ReferenceError).
Re-declaration and Update: Cannot be re-declared or updated. const is used for constants whose value wonâ€™t change.
Mutable Objects: If the const is an object or array, its properties or items can be changed, but you cannot reassign the variable itself.
