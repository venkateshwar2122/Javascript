/*The reduce() method in JavaScript is used to iterate over an array and accumulate a single value based on a callback function. 
Itâ€™s powerful for scenarios where you need to combine all elements of an array into a single result
(e.g., sum, product, average, or more complex transformations).
*/

/* to get result as a single value only based on sum functionality we will use  reduce()
syntax:

let r = arr.reduce((accumulator,ele,index,arr)=>{
                      stat1
                      statn

                      return acc
                      }initial_value_of_accumulator)


note that initial_value_of_accumulator is optional, if u want to initialise the value of acc then u can use.
But by default accumulator will take the first element value.
*/



/*  reduce() returns only single value, that is accumulators's value in the end

for ex:

let a = [1,2,3,4,5]

let r1 = a.reduce((acc,e)=>{
        return acc
})
console.log(r1)

output:
1
in above code accumulaor value by default is first element of array



NOTE : a return statement is must with accumulator value otherwise it will be undefined
forex:
let a = [1,2,3,4,5]

let r1 = a.reduce((acc,e)=>{
                                      // no return acc
})
console.log(r1)

output:
undefined

/* understand iteration of  reduce()
note : i have not done "return acc"
let a = [10,20,30,40,50]

let r1 = a.reduce((acc,e,index,arr)=>{
        
        console.log(acc)
        console.log(e)
        console.log(index)
        console.log(arr)

})
console.log(r1)

output:
