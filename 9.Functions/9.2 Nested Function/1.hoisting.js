console.log(add(10,20))              // fxn call

function add(x,y){                  // fxn definition
    return x+y
}

//no error even since is function is called before function definition
//because of hoisting concept

/*Hoisting is a JavaScript mechanism where variable and function declarations are moved to the top of 
their containing scope during the compilation phase.This means that you can use variables and functions 
before they are declared in the code.*/
