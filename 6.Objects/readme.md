This code snippet effectively demonstrates three distinct methods of accessing properties in a JavaScript object:

Dot Notation: Simplistic and direct for known property names.
Bracket Notation: Flexible for dynamic or non-standard property names.
For...in Loop: Comprehensive for iterating through all properties of an object.
These methods highlight the versatility of JavaScript objects and the ways to interact with their data.
